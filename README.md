<h4 align ="center">Hello Libre 3</h4>
<br><br>


The project started as a single script for the iPad Swift Playgrounds to test the workings of the several troublesome BLE devices I bought, mainly the **Bubble** and the **MiaoMiao**. It was then quickly converted to an app when the **Libre 2** came out at last by using a standard Xcode template: it should compile fine without external dependencies just after changing the _Bundle Identifier_ in the _General_ panel of the _Targets_ settings and the _Team_ in the _Signing and Capabilities_ tab of Xcode -- Spike and xDrip4iO5 users know already very well what that means... ;-)

I am targeting only the latest betas of Xcode and iOS.

***Disclaimer***: the decrypting keys I am publishing are not related to user accounts and can be dumped from the sensor memory by using DiaBLE itself. The online servers I am using probably are tracking your personal data but all the traffic sent/received by DiaBLE is clearly shown in its logs. The reversed code I am pasting has been retrieved from other GitHub repos or reproduced simply by using open-source tools like `jadx-gui`.
